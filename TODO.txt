Decide which approach to use for code syntax highlighting:

    no recent changes
  http://fifesoft.com/rsyntaxtextarea/ looks good and powerful but no recent changes

Implement a Scala Object Controller and a Scala Script Controller similar to Scala Object PR and Scala Script PR.
Or, should we merge them into Scala PR and Scala Controller and specify the script type e.g. using OR for the 
script file init parm?

Both the PR and the controller work with scala code that is in a separate file. 
Do we need to register persistence -- think not since the only thing that needs to get stored 
is the file URL.
The groovy controller stores the script with the controller object.
