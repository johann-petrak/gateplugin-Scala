Gateclassloader:

getResource:
  = try to get it from the parent
  = if nothing found, try Gate.getClassLoader().findResource(name);
  = if still nothing: 
    - get all the childClassLoaders
    - for each child classloader:
    - if it is not isolated, try to use it
    - until we find something, return it
  = if still nothing, return null
